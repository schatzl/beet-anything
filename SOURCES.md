## 🔬 Methodology

### Data Validation Process

1. **Primary Source Requirement**
   - All data must have at least one academic or extension source
   - Wikipedia used only for cross-reference, never as sole source

2. **Cross-Reference**
   - Each relationship verified in minimum 2 independent sources when possible
   - Contradictions resolved by prioritizing peer-reviewed sources

3. **Confidence Levels**
   - High confidence: 3+ sources, scientific studies
   - Medium confidence: 2 sources, traditional knowledge + extension
   - Low confidence: 1 source or Wikipedia only → NOT INCLUDED

4. **Update Cycle**
   - Sources reviewed: February 2025
   - Next review: Annually or when new research emerges

### Limitations

- **Geographic variation**: Some pest-plant relationships vary by region
- **Traditional knowledge**: Some companion planting based on observation, not controlled studies
- **Pest protection**: Mechanisms not fully understood for all relationships
- **Individual variation**: Results may vary based on soil, climate, cultivars

---

## 📝 Notes

**Conservative Approach**:
- When in doubt, relationships marked as neutral (0) rather than guessing
- Only well-documented pest protections included
- Controversial or weakly-supported claims excluded

**User Responsibility**:
- This data is for planning purposes only
- Always research specific to your region and climate
- Consult local agricultural extension for pest management advice
- Integrated Pest Management (IPM) recommended over companion planting alone
