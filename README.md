## 🧮 How the Algorithm Works

### Scoring System

The suggestion algorithm evaluates each vegetable-bed combination and assigns a score based on multiple criteria:

#### Family Rotation (+30/-20 points)
- **+30**: Different plant family than previous year ✅
- **-20**: Same plant family as previous year ⚠️

*Why*: Prevents soil-borne diseases and pest accumulation

#### Nutrition Rotation (+25/-15 points)
- **+25**: Light feeder after heavy feeder (soil regeneration) ✅
- **-15**: Heavy feeder after heavy feeder (soil depletion) ⚠️
- **+10**: Light feeder generally (soil-friendly) ✅

*Why*: Balances soil nutrients over time

#### Companion Planting (+15/-30 points)
- **+15**: Per good companion already in bed ✅
- **-30**: Per bad companion already in bed ⚠️

*Why*: Maximizes beneficial plant interactions

#### Other Factors
- **+5**: Empty bed (more flexibility)
- **-10**: Same plant grown 2 years ago (extended rotation)

### Result

Vegetables are assigned to beds with highest scores, ensuring:
- Optimal crop rotation
- Compatible plant combinations
- Soil health preservation
- Maximum harvest potential

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Crop Rotation Best Practices

1. **Build History**
   - Track at least 3 years of plantings
   - More history = better suggestions

2. **Respect Plant Families**
   - Never plant same family in consecutive years
   - Minimum 3-year gap for same family

3. **Balance Nutrition**
   - Follow heavy feeders with light feeders
   - Give soil time to regenerate

### Companion Planting Tips

1. **Check the Matrix**
   - Click "📊 View Matrix" for all combinations
   - Green ✓ = good companions
   - Red ✗ = avoid together

2. **Maximize Benefits**
   - Combine multiple good companions when possible
   - Examples:
     - Tomatoes + Basil + Carrot
     - Beans + Corn + Cucumber ("Three Sisters")

3. **Avoid Conflicts**
   - Never ignore bad companion warnings
   - Even if space is limited, find alternative arrangements

### Data Management

1. **Export Regularly**
   - Monthly exports recommended
   - Before any system changes
   - Keep in cloud storage

2. **Backup Before**
   - Clearing browser cache
   - Updating device OS
   - Switching devices
   - Uninstalling app

3. **Use Meaningful Bed Names**
   - "North Bed" better than "Bed 1"
   - "Tomato Patch" helps remember layout
   - "Raised Bed A" for structured gardens

```javascript
// Add to vegetable list
new Vegetable('beetroot', 'Beetroot', 'Rote Beete', 'Barbabietola', 'medium', 'Amaranthaceae'),

// Set companions
this.setCompanions('beetroot',
    ['onion', 'cabbage'],     // Good companions
    ['spinach', 'leek']       // Bad companions
);
```

### Add New Language

**Location**: Line ~1013 in HTML file

```javascript
// Add translation object
fr: {
    title: "Beet Anything",
    subtitle: "Rotation des cultures facile",
    // ... ~60 translation keys
}

// Update Vegetable class
constructor(id, nameEN, nameDE, nameIT, nameFR, ...) {
    this.nameFR = nameFR;
}

// Add button to HTML
<button onclick="app.setLanguage('fr')">FR</button>
```

### Adjust Algorithm

**Location**: Line ~1500 in HTML file

```javascript
// Change scoring weights
score += 50;  // Family rotation (was 30)
score -= 50;  // Bad companion (was 30)
```
