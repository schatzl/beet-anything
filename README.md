## 🧮 How the Algorithm Works

### Scoring System

The suggestion algorithm evaluates each vegetable-bed combination and assigns a score based on multiple criteria:

#### Family Rotation (+30/-20 points)
- **+30**: Different plant family than previous year ✅
- **-20**: Same plant family as previous year ⚠️

*Why*: Prevents soil-borne diseases and pest accumulation

#### Nutrition Rotation (+25/-15 points)
- **+25**: Light feeder after heavy feeder (soil regeneration) ✅
- **-15**: Heavy feeder after heavy feeder (soil depletion) ⚠️
- **+10**: Light feeder generally (soil-friendly) ✅

*Why*: Balances soil nutrients over time

#### Companion Planting (+15/-30 points)
- **+15**: Per good companion already in bed ✅
- **-30**: Per bad companion already in bed ⚠️

*Why*: Maximizes beneficial plant interactions

#### Pest Protection (+20/-15 points) *NEW!*
- **+20**: Protects other plants from pests ✅ 🛡️
- **-15**: Shares pest vulnerabilities with others ⚠️ 🦟
- **+10**: Attracts beneficial insects ✅ 🐞

*Why*: Natural pest control through companion planting

#### Other Factors
- **+5**: Empty bed (more flexibility)
- **-10**: Same plant grown 2 years ago (extended rotation)

### Result

Vegetables are assigned to beds with highest scores, ensuring:
- Optimal crop rotation
- Compatible plant combinations
- **Natural pest protection** (NEW!)
- Soil health preservation
- Maximum harvest potential

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Crop Rotation Best Practices

1. **Build History**
   - Track at least 3 years of plantings
   - More history = better suggestions

2. **Respect Plant Families**
   - Never plant same family in consecutive years
   - Minimum 3-year gap for same family

3. **Balance Nutrition**
   - Follow heavy feeders with light feeders
   - Give soil time to regenerate

### Companion Planting Tips

1. **Check the Matrix**
   - Click "📊 View Matrix" for all combinations
   - Green ✓ = good companions
   - Red ✗ = avoid together

2. **Maximize Benefits**
   - Combine multiple good companions when possible
   - Examples:
     - Tomatoes + Basil + Carrot
     - Beans + Corn + Cucumber ("Three Sisters")

3. **Avoid Conflicts**
   - Never ignore bad companion warnings
   - Even if space is limited, find alternative arrangements

### Pest Protection Strategies (NEW!)

1. **Use Protective Plants**
   - Plant onions near carrots → protects from carrot-fly
   - Plant garlic near strawberries → repels aphids and slugs
   - Plant chives near roses → deters aphids

2. **Attract Beneficial Insects**
   - Look for 🐞 emoji in plant metadata
   - Plants like basil, mint, fennel attract:
     - Ladybugs (eat aphids)
     - Lacewings (eat aphids and thrips)
     - Parasitic wasps (control caterpillars)

3. **Avoid Clustering Vulnerabilities**
   - Don't plant cabbage + broccoli + kohlrabi together
   - All attract same pests (cabbage-white butterfly)
   - Algorithm warns with ⚠️ 🦟 tags

4. **Watch for Protection Tags**
   - 🛡️ Green tag = This plant protects others
   - ⚠️ 🦟 Yellow tag = Plants share pest problems
   - 🐞 Emoji = Attracts beneficial insects

### Example Combinations

**✅ EXCELLENT: Carrot + Onion + Chives**
- Onion protects carrot from carrot-fly and slugs
- Chives attracts beneficials
- All have different nutrition needs
- Different families
- **Tooltip on 🛡️ Onion**: "Protects from: carrot-fly, aphids, slugs"

**✅ GREAT: Tomato + Basil**
- Basil protects tomato from aphids and whitefly
- Basil attracts pollinators
- Traditional good companions
- Algorithm gives +45 bonus points!
- **Tooltip on ✓ Basil**: "Traditional good companion • Protects from: aphids, whitefly, hornworms"

**✅ PERFECT: Lettuce + Chives**
- Chives protects lettuce from slugs and aphids
- Both vulnerable to slugs → Chives provides critical protection
- **Tooltip on 🛡️ Chives**: "Protects from: aphids, carrot-fly, slugs, japanese-beetle"

**❌ AVOID: Cabbage + Broccoli + Kohlrabi**
- All Brassicaceae family
- Share pests (cabbage-white, aphids, slugs)
- Heavy feeders compete for nutrients
- Algorithm warns heavily (-50 points)
- **Tooltip on 🪳 Broccoli**: "slugs, cabbage-white, aphids, cabbage-root-fly"

### Visual Indicators

**Pest Icons (Individual Plants):**
Each plant displays icons for its pest vulnerabilities:

```
🥕 Karotte
  Apiaceae
  🦟 🐛    ← Shows: Flying pests + Larvae
  
🥬 Salat
  Asteraceae
  🐌 🦟 🐛  ← Shows: Slugs + Flying pests + Larvae
  
🧅 Zwiebel
  Amaryllidaceae
  🦟       ← Shows: Only flying pests
```

**Hover for details:**
- 🐌 → "Slugs/Snails: slugs"
- 🦟 → "Flying pests (aphids, flies, moths): aphids, carrot-fly"
- 🐛 → "Larvae/Caterpillars: cabbage-white, wireworms"
- 🪲 → "Beetles: flea-beetle, potato-beetle"

**Benefits:**
- See vulnerabilities at a glance
- Works for single plants (not just in combinations)
- Categorized by pest type
- Detailed tooltips with specific pest names

### Data Management

1. **Export Regularly**
   - Monthly exports recommended
   - Before any system changes
   - Keep in cloud storage

2. **Backup Before**
   - Clearing browser cache
   - Updating device OS
   - Switching devices
   - Uninstalling app

3. **Use Meaningful Bed Names**
   - "North Bed" better than "Bed 1"
   - "Tomato Patch" helps remember layout
   - "Raised Bed A" for structured gardens
