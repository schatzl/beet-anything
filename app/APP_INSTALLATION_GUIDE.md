## Troubleshooting

### Install Button Doesn't Appear

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Already Installed**
   ```
   Check if app is already installed:
   - iOS: Look for icon on home screen
   - Android: Check app drawer
   - Desktop: Check Start Menu/Applications
   ```

2. **Wrong Browser**
   ```
   iOS: Must use Safari (not Chrome/Firefox)
   Android: Use Chrome, Edge, or Samsung Internet
   Desktop: Use Chrome, Edge, or Opera
   ```

3. **Not HTTPS**
   ```
   PWAs require HTTPS connection
   Check URL starts with https://
   Local file:// won't work for PWA
   ```

4. **Browser Too Old**
   ```
   Update your browser to latest version:
   iOS: Update iOS to 11.3+
   Android: Update Chrome
   Desktop: Update Chrome/Edge
   ```

### Can't Install on iOS

**Solution:**

1. Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome)
2. Check iOS version (must be 11.3+)
3. Try these steps:
   ```
   - Close all Safari tabs
   - Clear Safari cache
   - Restart iPhone
   - Try installation again
   ```

### App Doesn't Work Offline

**Solution:**

1. **Open app with internet first**
   - Service Worker needs to download files
   - First visit requires connection

2. **Check Service Worker registration**
   - Open app in browser
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application tab
   - Check Service Workers section

3. **Clear cache and reinstall**
   ```
   1. Uninstall PWA
   2. Clear browser cache
   3. Visit site with internet
   4. Install again
   ```

### Data Lost After Reinstalling

**Why:** Uninstalling PWA clears LocalStorage

**Prevention:**
```
ALWAYS export your data before:
- Uninstalling the app
- Clearing browser data
- Updating iOS/Android
- Switching devices
```

**Recovery:**
- Import your last export file
- If no backup exists, data is unrecoverable

   - Upload to cloud (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)

### Recommended Workflow (Multi-Device)

```
1. Choose "main" device (e.g., laptop)
2. Do most planning on main device
3. Export weekly
4. Import on other devices as needed
5. Make small changes on mobile
6. Export from mobile before big changes on laptop
```

## Advanced: Install from Local File

### For Development / Testing

**Requirements:**
- Local web server
- HTTPS (self-signed certificate OK for testing)

**Option 1: Python HTTP Server**

```bash
# Create self-signed certificate
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -nodes -out cert.pem -keyout key.pem -days 365

# Start HTTPS server (Python 3)
python3 -m http.server --bind localhost 8000 --protocol=https

# Visit
https://localhost:8000/beet-anything-i18n.html
```

**Option 2: Node.js HTTP Server**

npm install -g http-server

# Start with SSL
http-server -S -C cert.pem -K key.pem

# Visit
https://localhost:8080/beet-anything-i18n.html
